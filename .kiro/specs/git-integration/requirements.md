# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will set up Git version control for the NavyYard project, integrating with a private Gitea server at git.wlkns.org. The implementation will include initial repository setup, configuration of Git workflows, and documentation of Git practices for the project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Repository Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Git repository for the NavyYard project on a private Gitea server, so that I can track changes and manage the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the Git repository THEN the system SHALL create a properly structured Git repository in the project root.
2. WHEN configuring the remote repository THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the Gitea server at git.wlkns.org.
3. WHEN setting up the repository THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate .gitignore files are created to exclude unnecessary files.
4. WHEN committing the initial codebase THEN the system SHALL include all relevant project files while excluding virtual environments, cache files, and other non-versioned content.

### Requirement 2: Branch Structure and Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-defined Git branch structure and workflow, so that I can manage feature development, bug fixes, and releases in an organized manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the branch structure THEN the system SHALL establish a main/master branch as the primary stable branch.
2. WHEN defining the workflow THEN the system SHALL include guidelines for feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches.
3. WHEN documenting the workflow THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for branch creation, merging, and conflict resolution.
4. WHEN implementing the workflow THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with Gitea's pull request and code review features.

### Requirement 3: Git Hooks and Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Git hooks and automation scripts, so that I can ensure code quality and consistency across the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Git hooks THEN the system SHALL implement pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting.
2. WHEN configuring automation THEN the system SHALL establish post-merge hooks for dependency management if needed.
3. WHEN implementing hooks THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly documented and can be easily enabled by other developers.

### Requirement 4: Documentation and Guidelines

**User Story:** As a project contributor, I want clear Git usage documentation and guidelines, so that I can follow consistent practices when working with the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL include a Git section in the project README.md with basic usage instructions.
2. WHEN documenting Git practices THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for commit message formatting and best practices.
3. WHEN writing documentation THEN the system SHALL include instructions for common Git operations specific to the project workflow.
4. WHEN finalizing documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure it is accessible to all project contributors.

### Requirement 5: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want reliable backup and recovery procedures for the Git repository, so that I can prevent data loss and recover from potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing backup procedures THEN the system SHALL define methods for regular repository backups.
2. WHEN documenting recovery procedures THEN the system SHALL include steps for repository restoration in case of corruption or data loss.
3. WHEN implementing backup solutions THEN the system SHALL ensure they can be automated and scheduled.

### Requirement 6: Integration with Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Git workflow to integrate seamlessly with the existing development process, so that version control enhances rather than hinders productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Git THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with existing development tools and processes.
2. WHEN establishing the workflow THEN the system SHALL minimize disruption to current development practices.
3. WHEN documenting integration THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how Git fits into the overall development lifecycle.
