# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature will enhance the NavyYard chatbot by adding voice output capabilities. This feature will convert the chatbot's text responses into spoken audio, providing an alternative way for users to interact with the system. The TTS functionality will be integrated seamlessly with the existing chatbot architecture, maintaining its modular design while extending its capabilities to include audio output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic TTS Functionality

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want the system to read responses aloud, so that I can interact with the chatbot without having to read text on the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot generates a text response THEN the system SHALL convert this text to speech.
2. WHEN text is converted to speech THEN the system SHALL output the audio through the default audio device.
3. WHEN TTS is active THEN the system SHALL still display the text response in the terminal.
4. WHEN the TTS process is running THEN the system SHALL provide a way to interrupt it.

### Requirement 2: TTS Configuration

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want to be able to enable or disable TTS functionality, so that I can control when voice output is used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot starts THEN the system SHALL load TTS settings from the configuration file.
2. WHEN the user issues a command to toggle TTS THEN the system SHALL enable or disable TTS accordingly.
3. WHEN TTS settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply these changes immediately.
4. WHEN TTS is disabled THEN the system SHALL not attempt to generate speech for responses.

### Requirement 3: Voice Selection

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want to be able to select different voices for TTS, so that I can customize the audio experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TTS system initializes THEN the system SHALL identify available voices.
2. WHEN the user requests a list of available voices THEN the system SHALL display all available voices.
3. WHEN the user selects a specific voice THEN the system SHALL use that voice for subsequent TTS operations.
4. WHEN a selected voice is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default voice and notify the user.

### Requirement 4: TTS Performance

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want the TTS functionality to be responsive and not significantly slow down the chatbot, so that the voice interaction feels natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS is processing text THEN the system SHALL not block other chatbot operations.
2. WHEN TTS is enabled THEN the system SHALL begin speech output as soon as possible after text generation.
3. WHEN the chatbot is in streaming mode THEN the system SHALL handle TTS appropriately (either wait for complete response or speak in chunks).
4. WHEN TTS processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation without TTS.

### Requirement 5: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want the TTS functionality to work across different operating systems, so that all users can benefit from this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot runs on Windows THEN the system SHALL use appropriate TTS engines available on Windows.
2. WHEN the chatbot runs on macOS THEN the system SHALL use appropriate TTS engines available on macOS.
3. WHEN the chatbot runs on Linux THEN the system SHALL use appropriate TTS engines available on Linux.
4. WHEN platform-specific TTS is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to a cross-platform solution or disable TTS with appropriate notification.

### Requirement 7: Advanced TTS Engine Support

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want to use high-quality neural TTS engines like Coqui TTS, so that I can have more natural-sounding speech output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Coqui TTS is available THEN the system SHALL support Coqui TTS as an engine option.
2. WHEN using Coqui TTS THEN the system SHALL provide access to available Coqui TTS models and speakers.
3. WHEN a Coqui TTS model is selected THEN the system SHALL allow selection of different speakers within that model.
4. WHEN Coqui TTS models are not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to other available engines.
5. WHEN using neural TTS engines THEN the system SHALL handle longer processing times gracefully.

### Requirement 6: Integration with Personas

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want different personas to have different voices, so that I can easily distinguish between them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a persona is loaded THEN the system SHALL associate a specific voice with that persona.
2. WHEN the user switches personas THEN the system SHALL switch to the voice associated with the new persona.
3. WHEN a persona's voice setting is not specified THEN the system SHALL use the default voice.
4. WHEN the user changes a persona's voice THEN the system SHALL store this preference for future sessions.
