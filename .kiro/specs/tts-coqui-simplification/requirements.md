# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TTS Coqui Simplification feature will refactor the existing complex Coqui TTS integration in the NavyYard chatbot to create a more reliable, maintainable, and simpler implementation. The current implementation has several issues and complexity that make it difficult to maintain and debug. This refactoring will strip out the complex integration and rebuild it with a simpler approach while maintaining all the necessary functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Simplified Coqui TTS Engine

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want a simplified Coqui TTS engine implementation, so that it's easier to maintain and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Coqui TTS engine THEN the system SHALL use a minimal approach with only essential features.
2. WHEN initializing the TTS engine THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.
3. WHEN the TTS engine fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative TTS engines.
4. WHEN using the simplified Coqui TTS engine THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing TTSEngineBase interface.

### Requirement 2: GPU Configuration Control

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want to be able to control whether Coqui TTS uses GPU acceleration, so that I can avoid CUDA-related issues on systems with problematic GPU configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the Coqui TTS engine THEN the system SHALL respect the use_gpu configuration setting.
2. WHEN use_gpu is set to false THEN the system SHALL disable CUDA for the TTS engine.
3. WHEN the TTS engine is configured THEN the system SHALL provide a way to toggle GPU usage without restarting the application.
4. WHEN GPU usage causes errors THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to CPU mode.

### Requirement 3: Seamless Integration with Existing System

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want the simplified TTS implementation to integrate seamlessly with the existing system, so that all current functionality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simplified TTS engine is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the TTSManager class.
2. WHEN personas are configured with specific voices THEN the system SHALL continue to respect these configurations.
3. WHEN TTS commands are issued THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly with the new implementation.
4. WHEN the system is updated THEN the system SHALL not break existing functionality in other components.

### Requirement 4: Improved Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want improved error handling and diagnostics for TTS functionality, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in the TTS engine THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information.
2. WHEN the TTS engine fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL provide specific information about what went wrong.
3. WHEN TTS operations fail THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully without crashing.
4. WHEN diagnosing TTS issues THEN the system SHALL provide tools or commands to test TTS functionality.

### Requirement 5: Minimal Dependencies

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want the TTS functionality to have minimal dependencies, so that it's easier to install and use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the TTS engine THEN the system SHALL use only necessary dependencies.
2. WHEN importing TTS-related modules THEN the system SHALL use lazy imports to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
3. WHEN the TTS engine is not used THEN the system SHALL not require TTS-specific dependencies to be installed.
4. WHEN installing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which dependencies are optional for TTS functionality.
