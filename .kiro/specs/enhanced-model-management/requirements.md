# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Model Management feature will improve the NavyYard chatbot's model handling capabilities by providing clear visibility into the active model's status, ensuring reliable GPU acceleration, and optimizing the model switching process. This feature will address several user experience issues related to model management, including the lack of immediate feedback about the active model's configuration, the inability to switch models directly after startup, and performance issues during persona switching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Status Banner Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see immediately at startup and after each model change which model is running on which hardware (CPU/GPU), so that I don't have to guess or specifically query the configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot starts THEN the system SHALL display a status banner showing the active model, hardware mode (CPU/GPU), and active persona.
2. WHEN the user changes the model THEN the system SHALL display an updated status banner with the new model information.
3. WHEN the hardware mode changes (CPU/GPU) THEN the system SHALL reflect this in the status banner.
4. WHEN the status banner is displayed THEN the system SHALL format it in a clear, visually distinct way.
5. WHEN the status banner is displayed THEN the system SHALL include the number of GPU layers if running in GPU mode.

### Requirement 2: Immediate Model Command Availability

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to use the !model <n> command immediately after startup, so that I'm not forced to first run !models to create the index.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot starts THEN the system SHALL pre-index available models.
2. WHEN the user issues a !model <n> command THEN the system SHALL respond correctly even if !models has not been run previously.
3. WHEN the user issues a !model command without arguments THEN the system SHALL display information about the currently loaded model.
4. WHEN the model index is created THEN the system SHALL do this in a way that doesn't noticeably delay startup time.

### Requirement 3: Optimized Persona Switching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to switch personas lightning-fast without the entire AI model being reloaded, so that I have a fluid and uninterrupted experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches personas THEN the system SHALL maintain the currently loaded model.
2. WHEN a persona switch occurs THEN the system SHALL only update the persona-specific configuration.
3. WHEN measuring the time to switch personas THEN the system SHALL complete the switch in under 1 second.
4. WHEN a persona is switched THEN the system SHALL update the status banner to reflect the new persona.

### Requirement 4: Hardware Status Awareness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the model wrapper component to know its own hardware status (CPU/GPU), so that other parts of the application can reliably query and display this information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model wrapper initializes a model THEN the system SHALL detect and store the hardware mode (CPU/GPU).
2. WHEN the hardware mode changes THEN the system SHALL update the stored hardware status.
3. WHEN other components request the hardware status THEN the system SHALL provide accurate information.
4. WHEN running in GPU mode THEN the system SHALL detect and store the number of GPU layers being used.
5. WHEN the hardware status is queried THEN the system SHALL provide this information without re-detecting it each time.

### Requirement 5: Reliable GPU Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GPU settings to be reliably applied with every model change to avoid a critical error where the system silently falls back to the slow CPU mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is loaded THEN the system SHALL explicitly set the desired GPU configuration.
2. WHEN GPU acceleration fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user rather than silently falling back to CPU mode.
3. WHEN the system detects it's running in CPU mode despite GPU being requested THEN the system SHALL log a warning.
4. WHEN GPU settings are applied THEN the system SHALL verify they were applied correctly.
5. WHEN the system configuration changes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent GPU settings across model reloads.
