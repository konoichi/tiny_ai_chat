# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TTS Complete Removal feature will eliminate all Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality and dependencies from the NavyYard chatbot project. This includes removing all TTS-related code, configuration, dependencies, documentation, and tests to create a clean chatbot project without any TTS remnants or side effects. The goal is to simplify the project by focusing solely on text-based chat functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Code Removal

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want all TTS-related code completely removed from the project, so that the codebase is clean and focused on core chat functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing TTS functionality THEN the system SHALL delete all TTS-specific Python files including tts_manager.py, tts_engines.py, and all TTS wrapper/helper modules.
2. WHEN cleaning imports THEN the system SHALL remove all TTS-related imports from all remaining modules including main.py, persona managers, and other components.
3. WHEN removing TTS methods THEN the system SHALL eliminate all TTS-related methods, classes, and function calls including say(), tts_on(), tts_off(), voice_selection(), and similar functions.
4. WHEN cleaning event handlers THEN the system SHALL remove all TTS-specific event handlers, command parsers, and related functionality.

### Requirement 2: Configuration Cleanup

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want all TTS-related configuration removed from the project, so that there are no unused or confusing configuration options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning configuration files THEN the system SHALL remove all TTS configuration parameters from config files and default values.
2. WHEN updating settings THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-related sections from settings.yaml and other configuration files.
3. WHEN cleaning persona configurations THEN the system SHALL remove voice-related settings from persona definition files.
4. WHEN updating command configurations THEN the system SHALL remove TTS command definitions and help text.

### Requirement 3: Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want all TTS-related dependencies removed from the project, so that the installation is lighter and simpler.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating requirements THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-related dependencies from requirements.txt including TTS, coqui-ai, and TTS-specific PyTorch packages.
2. WHEN cleaning imports THEN the system SHALL ensure no remaining code references removed TTS dependencies.
3. WHEN updating build scripts THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-related installation steps from run.sh and other setup scripts.
4. WHEN validating dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure the project runs without any TTS dependencies installed.

### Requirement 4: Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want all documentation updated to reflect the removal of TTS functionality, so that there's no confusion about available features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating README THEN the system SHALL remove all references to TTS functionality from project documentation.
2. WHEN updating help text THEN the system SHALL remove TTS commands from help documentation and command lists.
3. WHEN updating configuration docs THEN the system SHALL remove TTS configuration examples and explanations.
4. WHEN updating feature lists THEN the system SHALL remove TTS from feature descriptions and capabilities.

### Requirement 5: Test Cleanup

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want all TTS-related tests removed or updated, so that the test suite is clean and focused on remaining functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning test files THEN the system SHALL remove all TTS-specific test files and test methods.
2. WHEN updating integration tests THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-related test cases from integration test suites.
3. WHEN updating selftest functionality THEN the system SHALL remove TTS checks from system self-test procedures.
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining tests pass without TTS dependencies.

### Requirement 6: Error Handling Cleanup

**User Story:** As a chatbot developer, I want all TTS-related error handling removed, so that there are no unused error handlers or logging statements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning error handlers THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-specific error handling code and exception types.
2. WHEN updating logging THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-related log messages and status reporting.
3. WHEN cleaning status displays THEN the system SHALL remove TTS status information from system status displays.
4. WHEN updating debug output THEN the system SHALL remove TTS-related debug information and diagnostics.

### Requirement 7: System Integrity

**User Story:** As a chatbot user, I want the system to function perfectly after TTS removal, so that all remaining functionality works without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing non-TTS functionality without degradation.
2. WHEN starting the chatbot THEN the system SHALL initialize successfully without any TTS-related errors or warnings.
3. WHEN using persona switching THEN the system SHALL continue to work correctly without voice-related features.
4. WHEN running commands THEN the system SHALL execute all non-TTS commands without issues or references to removed functionality.
